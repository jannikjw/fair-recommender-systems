    "**Initial Assumptions:**\n",
    "- If a piece is aligned with a person's interest, they prefer it\n",
    "- We present 10 pieces of content to each user \n",
    "- When presented with content, the user clicks on 0 or 1 piece of content\n",
    "- Content has attributes:\n",
    "    - leaning\n",
    "    - clickbaityness\n",
    "- User has attributes:\n",
    "    - opinion\n",
    "    - satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Assumptions:**\n",
    "- On each topic, a user has an opinion and a piece of content also has a leaning. The closer opinion and leaning are, the more satisfaction a user derives from the piece of content\n",
    "- If a user likes a piece content their opinion shifts in the direction of the content's leaning  \n",
    "- Users generally do not notice/dislike that they are in a filter bubble\n",
    "- While content might have a general leaning, liking/disliking is more complex than that -> I might agree with the infrastructure bill even though I am a republican -> This effect is stronger the closer to the edge of my filter bubble I am\n",
    "- We could research some social science studies on filter bubbles and why people click on what to model it"
