Welcome to the repository for Jannik and Madison's Final Project for COMS 6998: Fair and Robust Algorithms!

Below is the abstract of our final report.

### Abstract

Recommender systems (RSs), which offer personalized suggestions to users, power many of today's social media, e-commerce, and entertainment services. However, they have been known to create filter bubbles, a term used to describe the phenomenon wherein users are only shown content that aligns with their preconceived tastes and opinions. Past research has shown filter bubbles to be related to ideological extremism and systematic bias against marginalized groups. We mitigate such effects by introducing new notions of exploration into our recommender system (RS) model and measuring the trade-offs between accuracy and other metrics, such as diversity, novelty, and serendipity. We also examine the effect of filter bubble-mitigation strategies on user behavior homogenization by analyzing inter- versus intra-bubble homogeneity dynamics. You can find our implementation at https://github.com/jannikjw/fair-recommender-systems.
