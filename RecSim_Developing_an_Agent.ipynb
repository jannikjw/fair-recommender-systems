That is, each cluster becomes an arm. Once the algorithm has chosen a cluster, we serve take the highest quality video from that cluster. This is a metaphor for a situation that occurs often in recommender systems that serve as a front end to multiple (sub-)products: within each session, the user will interact with the recommender with some intent in mind, that is, to realize some task that can be fulfilled by one of the possible sub-products. Sometimes, the user will issue an explicit query (e.g., enter search terms), which effectively makes that intent observable up ot query interpretation uncertainty. Most often, however, the intent will be latent -- the user will reveal it indirectly by chosing among a set of items from the slate. We assume that had the intent been observable, a product-specific policy would be available to fulfill it.   \n",

For this reason, RecSim's approach to agent engineering is very modular. Instead of providing a wide array of agents, we provide an easily extendable set of agent building blocks, called Agent Layers, which could be combined into hierarchies to create more complex agents.\n",

Hierarchical  layers  are  defined  by  their  pre-  and  post-processing functions and can play many roles dependinghow these are implemented. For example, a layer can beused as a pure feature injector — it can extract some feature from the (history of) observations and pass it to the base agent, while keeping the post-processing function vacuous. This allows decoupling of feature- and agent-engineering. Various regularizers can be implemented in a similar fashion by modifying the reward.

The precondition is that the response space has a key 'click', as well as 'cluster_id'. If this is met, than the layer can be used with any environment/agent. Let's see how this works."
